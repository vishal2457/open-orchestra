`Open Orchestra` is a skill pack for agents that run a ticket-driven software delivery workflow from requirements to PR review and issue closure.

## What This Repo Does

This repository stores reusable agent skills in `skills/*/SKILL.md`. Our core philosophy is to implement AI agents in a way that mirrors how a real development team works in an agile environment — ticket by ticket, grounded in the actual codebase.

Each skill defines:
- when it should run
- required inputs
- exact outputs
- guardrails and handoff to the next step
- workflow tags and open-question behavior

The goal is to make issue execution consistent, auditable, and fast — without the overhead of maintaining external architecture documentation.

## Core Design Philosophy

**The code is the architecture document.**

Rather than requiring pre-built architecture snapshots that drift out of date, `planning-agent` reads the ticket requirements, navigates the live codebase using search and file-reading tools (`grep`, `ripgrep`, `find`, `view_file`), and produces a short, precise technical plan grounded in what the code actually looks like right now.

This means:
- No architecture initialization ritual before every ticket.
- The coding agent always sees the real, current state of the code.
- Less maintenance overhead; fewer stale context files confusing the agent.
- Implementation subtasks reference actual file paths and existing patterns — not guesses from an outdated doc.

**If you want architecture docs:** You can still create or maintain them. Pass them as optional context when invoking `planning-agent`, and the agent will read them alongside the live code. They inform but do not replace codebase inspection.

## Tracker Audit Trail Contract

All tracker-writing skills must leave an explicit audit trail. A run is incomplete unless all items below are present:

- Rich artifact content (issue/subtask body), not title-only updates.
- `Reasoning` section that explains why the agent chose the proposed scope/plan.
- `References` section listing exact inputs used (ticket fields, child tasks, files, PR links, commands when relevant).
- `Assumptions` section with unresolved unknowns and inferred decisions.
- Parent issue comment named `Execution-Trace` with:
  - actions performed (in order),
  - key decisions,
  - blockers/open questions,
  - `Skill-Version` stamp.

If any required section is missing, the skill must add a correction comment and keep the issue in blocked/open-questions state instead of marking the stage done.

## JSON Contract for Audit Trail and Handoff

In addition to readable markdown sections, each agent must emit machine-parseable JSON blocks for deterministic chaining and validation.

`Execution-Trace` JSON contract:

```json
{
  "agent": "planning-agent",
  "skill_version": "planning-agent@0.0.1",
  "timestamp_utc": "2026-02-22T10:30:00Z",
  "actions": ["read_parent_issue", "inspected_codebase", "created_technical_plan", "created_implement_subtasks", "estimated_story_points"],
  "decisions": ["split_api_and_ui_work", "deferred_non_blocking_cleanup"],
  "blockers": [],
  "open_questions": [],
  "references": ["LIN-123", "src/routes/v1/router.ts", "src/models/order.ts"]
}
```

`Workflow-Handoff` JSON contract:

```json
{
  "from_agent": "planning-agent",
  "to_agent": "implementation-agent",
  "status": "ready|blocked",
  "required_tags": ["planning-done"],
  "open_question_tags": [],
  "summary": "Technical plan posted. Implementation subtasks created and prioritized.",
  "artifacts": ["LIN-456", "LIN-457", "LIN-458"],
  "next_actions": ["implement_subtasks_in_order", "publish_pr_when_complete"]
}
```

Required rules:
- Use valid JSON objects (no comments, no trailing commas).
- Keep key names stable so downstream agents can parse consistently.
- If `status` is `blocked`, include at least one `open_question_tags` entry and describe the blocker in `summary`.

## Available Skills

- `requirements-ticket-agent`: Converts informal user requests into structured initial tickets by asking clarifying questions and outputting Title, Body, and Acceptance Criteria.
- `triage-agent`: Classifies an existing parent issue as `trivial|standard|complex`, suggests `skip_steps`, and routes to the correct next stage.
- `planning-agent`: Reads ticket requirements, inspects the live codebase, produces a short precise technical plan, and creates implementation subtasks. Optionally accepts user-provided architecture docs or reference files as additional context.
- `qa-agent`: Creates a `qa-plan` subtask with ticket-native test cases derived from functional requirements and the implementation subtasks. Runs after planning.
- `implementation-agent`: Implements `implement` subtasks in sequence, updates tracker status/tags, records build/lint outcomes, and publishes the PR when implementation is complete.
- `pr-review-agent`: Performs a risk-focused PR review with severity-ranked findings and a merge recommendation.

### Deprecated Skills (Retained for Reference)

- `init-architect`: Previously initialized architecture artifacts under `architecture/`. No longer part of the standard workflow. See deprecation notice in `skills/init-architect/SKILL.md`.
- `architect-agent`: Previously created a `technical-details` subtask from architecture docs. Replaced by `planning-agent`'s built-in codebase inspection. See deprecation notice in `skills/architect-agent/SKILL.md`.

## Typical Workflow

```
requirements-ticket-agent  →  triage-agent  →  planning-agent  →  implementation-agent  →  pr-review-agent
                                                      ↓ (parallel)
                                                  qa-agent
```

1. Install skills in the target repository.
2. Create or identify a parent issue.
3. For net-new requests without a usable parent issue body, run `requirements-ticket-agent` first to create/normalize requirements on the parent issue.
4. Run `triage-agent` once a parent issue exists to classify execution track and propose routing.
5. `triage-agent` routes to `requirements-ticket-agent` (if requirements are missing) or directly to `planning-agent` (if requirements are done).
6. `planning-agent` reads the ticket, inspects the live codebase, posts a technical plan, and creates implementation subtasks.
7. `qa-agent` runs after planning completes and creates a QA plan subtask. QA is a parallel quality gate — it does not block implementation.
8. `planning-agent` auto-invokes `implementation-agent` when planning is complete.
9. `implementation-agent` publishes the PR as part of the same run and auto-invokes `pr-review-agent` unless implementation questions are open.
10. `pr-review-agent` loops back to `implementation-agent` when fixes are required, or completes when review is clean.

### Optional: Architecture Docs as Extra Context

If your project maintains architecture documentation, you can pass it to `planning-agent` as optional context:

```
Use $planning-agent for LIN-123 with context: architecture/architecture.md
```

The planning agent will read the provided file alongside the live codebase. This is useful for large projects where you want to capture high-level system boundaries, security constraints, or cross-service contracts.

## Workflow Tag Contract

Parent issue completion tags:
- `requirements-done`
- `planning-done`
- `qa-done`
- `implementation-done`
- `pr-published`
- `pr-reviewed`

Parent issue open-question tags (agent-scoped):
- `open-requirements-questions`
- `open-planning-questions`
- `open-qa-questions`
- `open-implementation-questions`
- `open-pr-review-questions`

Every agent writes a `Workflow-Handoff` comment block and the next agent reads only the previous agent's handoff block for open-question checks.

> **Migration note:** Tags `architecture-done`, `qa-plan-created`, and `implemented` are still accepted as legacy prerequisites during transition to the new workflow.

## Project Setup

The workflow is designed to be zero-config. When you run any entry-point skill (`requirements-ticket-agent`, `triage-agent`, or `planning-agent`) for the first time in a new repository, it will automatically create a default `/orchestra-config.json` file in the root directory.

By default, the system assumes you are using **Linear**. To switch to **Jira**, simply edit the `issue_tracker` value in `orchestra-config.json` after it has been created.

## How To Use These Skills

1. Open this repo in Codex (or your agent runtime that supports `SKILL.md` workflows).
2. Kick off the workflow manually with the first needed skill (for example: `Use $planning-agent for LIN-123`).
3. Provide the inputs listed in that skill's `Required Inputs` section.
4. Execute the skill; downstream agents chain automatically unless an `open-*-questions` tag blocks progression.

## Notes

- These skills read `orchestra-config.json` for runtime tracker selection (`linear` or `jira`).
- If the configured tracker MCP is unavailable, the skill must stop and not proceed with tracker operations.
- Each skill carries a `version` and stamps `Skill-Version: <skill-name>@<version>` in tracker artifacts for traceability.
- Some skills also expect Git and GitHub CLI (`gh`) access for branch/PR operations.
- If your team process differs, edit each `SKILL.md` guardrail/procedure to match your policy.
