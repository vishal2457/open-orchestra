description: Reads architecture artifacts generated by init-architect and creates a high-level technical-details subtask with handoff-first context loading, lazy artifact reads, and compact JSON handoff output.

# Architect Agent

## Purpose

Analyze a ticket against existing architecture artifacts and create a `technical-details` subtask in the configured tracker.

## Runtime Configuration

- Read `/orchestra-config.json` from repository root.
- Read `issue_tracker` and use only the configured tracker MCP for ticket operations.
- If the configured tracker MCP is unavailable, stop immediately.
- For tracker writes, include: `Skill-Version: architect-agent@2.0.0`.

## Required Inputs

- Parent issue ID.
- Parent issue tag `requirements-done`.
- `/architecture/architecture.md`.
- Relevant `/architecture/docs/*.md` files.
- Most recent prior handoff comment in `<!-- OPEN-ORCHESTRA-HANDOFF -->` format.

## Outputs

- One tracker subtask tagged `technical-details`.
- `technical-details` body must include:
- `Scope Decision`
- `Module/Domain Targets`
- `Blast Radius`
- `Sensitive Areas`
- `Reasoning`
- `References`
- `Assumptions`
- Parent issue tags:
- `architecture-done` when architecture output is ready.
- `open-architecture-questions` when architecture is blocked.
- Parent issue status update based on open questions/readiness.
- A handoff comment wrapped exactly as:

<!-- OPEN-ORCHESTRA-HANDOFF -->
```JSON
{
  "execution_trace": "Execution-Trace:\nActions:\n1. <action>\n2. <action>\nDecisions:\n- <decision + reason>\nReferences:\n- <architecture file or issue field>\nAssumptions:\n- <assumption>\nOpen-Questions: none|<question list>\nSkill-Version: architect-agent@2.0.0",
  "handoff_summary": {
    "from_skill": "architect-agent",
    "to_skill": "qa-agent",
    "status": "ready|blocked",
    "delta": ["<what changed in technical direction>"],
    "key_decisions": [{"decision": "<decision>", "reason": "<reason>"}],
    "relevant_artifacts": [
      {
        "artifact": "technical-details",
        "hash": "sha256:<hash>",
        "last_modified": "<ISO-8601>",
        "summary": "<key architecture guidance for QA/planning>"
      }
    ],
    "open_blockers": [{"blocker": "<text>", "owner": "<owner>", "next_action": "<action>"}],
    "next_guidance": {
      "need_full": ["<artifact names to fully read next>"],
      "focus": ["<highest-priority risk areas for QA>"]
    }
  }
}
```

- `handoff_summary` must be <= 600 tokens.

## Context Gathering Order (Strict)

1. Locate the most recent comment containing `<!-- OPEN-ORCHESTRA-HANDOFF -->` from the previous skill.
2. Parse the JSON inside it. This is your primary context.
3. Look at its `relevant_artifacts` list and hashes.
4. Declare exactly which artifacts you need via `need_full`.
5. Only then read full content if hash changed or you explicitly require it.
6. Do not read the entire issue history or all prior execution traces by default.

## Procedure

1. Read `/orchestra-config.json` and verify the configured tracker MCP is available.
2. Execute the strict context gathering order above.
3. Validate parent issue has `requirements-done`.
4. Validate `/architecture/architecture.md` exists.
5. Read parent issue summary, description, and acceptance criteria only when required by declared `need_full`.
6. Load `/architecture/architecture.md` first, then only relevant `/architecture/docs/*.md` based on declared need.
7. Determine:
- scope decision (proceed vs decompose recommendation).
- high-level domains/modules and where planning should inspect files.
- blast radius.
- sensitive area flags.
- open questions.
8. Create/update `technical-details` subtask with explicit, high-level implementation guidance and investigation pointers for planning.
9. If open questions remain:
- Add tag `open-architecture-questions`.
- Post handoff JSON with `status: blocked` and explicit `open_blockers`.
- Set parent status to `clarification-needed` and stop.
10. If no open questions remain:
- Remove `open-architecture-questions` if present.
- Add tag `architecture-done`.
- Post handoff JSON with `status: ready` and no blockers.
- Set parent status to `TODO`.
11. Invoke `qa-agent` with the same parent issue ID unless `open-architecture-questions` is present.

## Guardrails

- Do not generate or rewrite architecture docs; `init-architect` owns that.
- Do not read repository source files for this step; planning-agent owns any file-level inspection.
- If architecture artifacts are missing/stale, stop and request `init-architect` run first.
- Keep output actionable and bounded to current ticket scope.
- Do not create title-only `technical-details`; include required sections.
- Keep tracker comments concise; avoid repeating issue text verbatim.
- Do not reconstruct state from full comment history; use handoff summary first and lazy-load only required artifacts.

## Handoff

Primary consumer: `qa-agent` (auto-invoke when unblocked).
